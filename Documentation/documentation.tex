\part{CryptoGateway Library} \label{sec:cryptogateway}

	\chapter{Introduction}

	The CryptoGateway library contains classes which handle cryptography.  CryptoGateway is designed as an open source library, so much of the cryptography within the library is relatively simple.  CryptoGateway is not meant to define cryptography to be used widely, rather, it is meant to provide a series of generalized hooks and interfaces which can be extended to various cryptographic algorithms.
		
		\section{Namespace} \label{sec:Namespace}
		CryptoGateway uses the crypto namespace.  The crypto namespace is designed for class, functions and constants related to cryptography.  CrytpoGateway depends on many of the tools defined in the os namespace.  Additionally, the crypto namespace contains a series of nested namespaces which help to disambiguate constants.
